# Amazon Price Tracker

## Project Overview

The Amazon Price Tracker is a Python project designed to monitor the prices of products on Amazon. This script extracts the product title and current price, saving this information into a CSV file. It runs continuously, checking the price at regular intervals, and can alert you when the price drops below a specified threshold.

This project includes:
- **Web Scraping**: Utilizing `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to fetch and parse product details from Amazon.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms to deal with network issues, missing elements, and other potential problems.
- **Logging**: Logging all operations and errors to a file, making it easier to debug and monitor the scraper's activity.
- **Data Storage**: Storing the extracted data in a CSV file for future analysis.

## Features

- **Continuous Monitoring**: The script runs in a loop, checking the product price at user-defined intervals.
- **Price Alerts**: Notifies users when the product price falls below the specified threshold.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores price data along with the date for long-term tracking and analysis.
